# Introduction
This is my individual examination in react.

I have created a Single Page Application (SPA) with three views.

#### About Me
In this view, I briefly introduce myself and things i have learned.

#### Project
This view you can find my GitHub repositories, it fetches data from the GitHub API to display a list of my projects. Each project is shown as a link that takes the you to the GitHub page for that specific project.

#### Contact
This view features a contact form where users can contact me by submitting their name, email, and message.

#### ThemeToggler Component (with Redux)
The ThemeToggler component, integrated with Redux, allows users to switch between light and dark themes on the website. It provides a user-friendly way to adjust the visual appearance of the site according to their preference.

## To run the website locally on your computer, follow these steps:
1. Clone this GitHub repository to your computer.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Install the project's dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
4. Then, start the development server by running the command `npm run dev`.
5. Open your web browser and go to the localhost address provided to view the website in your browser.
